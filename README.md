# Java-Pizza-Ordering-System


This code implements a simple pizza ordering system. It allows users to input their name, address, phone number, and the quantity and size of pizzas they want to order. Users can also add toppings to their pizzas and choose whether or not they want delivery.

The code then calculates the total cost of the order, including toppings and delivery. If the order is over Â£20, the code applies a 10% discount.

Finally, the code displays a summary of the order, including the user's information, the pizzas they ordered, the total cost, and any discounts that were applied.
